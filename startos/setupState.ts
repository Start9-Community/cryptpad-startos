/**
 * Setup-token state derived from CryptPad's decree log.
 *
 * # Why this file has no imports
 *
 * Deliberately dependency-free. The parser is the one piece of hand-rolled,
 * upstream-version-sensitive logic in this package, and it has already caused a
 * real bug once, so it carries a regression test (`setupState.test.ts`). Keeping
 * it free of imports means the test runs under plain `node --test` without
 * pulling in the SDK, the manifest, or any StartOS runtime.
 *
 * The I/O half lives in `utils.ts`, which reads the file through the
 * `decreeLog` file model and hands the raw contents here.
 *
 * # Decree shape
 *
 * Verified against `lib/api.js@2026.5.1` — the token is `Hash.createChannelId()`
 * concatenated twice, emitted as:
 *
 *     ["ADD_INSTALL_TOKEN", [token], "", +new Date()]
 *
 * The log is newline-delimited JSON at `/data/decrees/decree.ndjson`.
 *
 * # Completion signal — verified against a real wizard run
 *
 * CryptPad does NOT emit a paired RM_INSTALL_TOKEN decree when the install
 * wizard finishes; the token line stays in the log forever. A real log after a
 * successful wizard run looks like:
 *
 *     ["ADD_INSTALL_TOKEN", ["<64-hex-token>"], "", t0]  ← from boot
 *     ["ADD_ADMIN_KEY",     ["<44-char-key=>"], "", t1]  ← from wizard
 *     ["SET_INSTANCE_NAME",   …]                         ← wizard customization
 *     ["SET_INSTANCE_DESCRIPTION", …]
 *     …
 *
 * `lib/api.js` only emits ADD_INSTALL_TOKEN when the instance has zero admins;
 * once an admin exists the existing token is simply never referenced again. So
 * "setup is done" is the presence of any ADD_ADMIN_KEY decree, not the removal
 * of the token.
 *
 * Note the envelope subtlety: the wizard's first-admin path sends
 * `['ADD_FIRST_ADMIN', ['ADD_ADMIN_KEY', [key]]]`, but `adminDecree` reads
 * `data[1]`, so what actually lands in the log is `["ADD_ADMIN_KEY", [key], …]`.
 * Scanning for ADD_ADMIN_KEY is therefore correct.
 *
 * Why it matters: the original RM_-scan parser would have left the setup task
 * pending forever regardless of wizard completion, and combined with the prior
 * 'critical' severity that produced an unrecoverable startup deadlock.

 * be set while the daemon has not yet emitted ADD_INSTALL_TOKEN. That is
 * 'waiting-for-daemon'.
 *
 * Tolerant by design: rows whose args are not an array (upstream really does
 * emit `["PROOFS_MIGRATED", 1, "server", t]`) and malformed trailing lines from
 * a partial append are skipped rather than throwing.
