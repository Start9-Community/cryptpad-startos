# DO NOT add nginx / Caddy / Traefik or any other reverse proxy to this image.
# CryptPad's Node server already serves the correct CSP / COEP / CORP headers
# for the /checkup/ self-test (see cryptpad-server@1.0.3 http.worker setHeaders);
# an in-container proxy duplicates them and breaks browser security checks.
# StartOS terminates TLS at the platform layer — there is nothing for an
# in-container proxy to do.
#
# CryptPad's HTTP server on port 3000 accepts the /cryptpad_websocket upgrade
# itself and relays it to its internal front nodes (cryptpad-server@1.0.3
# http.worker: httpServer.on("upgrade", wsProxyUpgrade)). Those internal
# ports, set in the generated infra.js, must NEVER be bound externally.

FROM cryptpad/cryptpad:version-2026.10.0

# Bake the office editors (Document / Sheet / Presentation, Euro-Office based) into the image
# at build time so users don't pay a 10–15 minute first-start download.
#
# install-office.sh writes to TWO paths:
#   - /cryptpad/www/common/onlyoffice/dist/   ← per-version assets, image rootfs
#   - /cryptpad/onlyoffice-conf/              ← state, MUST be a volume mount
#
# Only `dist/` is baked here. `onlyoffice-conf/` is mounted from the StartOS
# main volume at runtime (see startos/main.ts mountVolume); the install
# script idempotently re-checks state on subsequent runs against the
# onlyoffice.properties file in conf/.
#
# Flags (verified against install-office.sh@2026.10.0):
#   --accept-license     — bypass the interactive license review
#   --trust-repository   — git safe.directory for the cloned onlyoffice-builds
#                          repo (the build runs as root which mismatches the
#                          UID gitconfig would otherwise want)
#
# Build-time network deps: github.com (clones cryptpad/onlyoffice-builds
# and the editor / x2t release archives), plus raw.githubusercontent.com for
# the (license-header) curl. Documented in
# README "Building from Source".
